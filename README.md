# CS-210

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:

- The project I am choosing is the Chada Tech clock project from module 3.
- The goal of this project was to create a clock that would display the time to the user in both 12 and 24 hour format and allow the user to add an hour, minute, or second to the clock.
- This was meant to be an "audition" for the role at Chada Tech to showcase my skills as a programmer.

What did you do particularly well?

- This the toughest question to answer. I didn't feel as though I had a great grasp of C++ at the time.
- If I had to pick one thing that I am happiest is with would be formatting the look of the clock. I was very happy that I was able to get the display in a place that I was happy with and met expectations. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

- If I were to go back and enhance my code on this project, I would ensure that the times being displayed was always accurate.
- I would either implement a form of input validation and error handling, or just have the clock import the user's local time when the accessed the program.
- I could also implment the times as a class using public and private members.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

- The most diffucult code to write was converting the user input for the 24 hour clock into the time for the 12 hour clock.
- I was able to figure out that using a modulo operator would have given me the appriate hour.
- However, I wasn't able to implement this accurately as the clocks did not always display the appropriate time.
- There are several ways that I could now go back and improve this project with my current level of understanding of C++.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

- The main skill I can take away from this project would be to always looking for ways to improve upon my previous work.
- While this project did test my abilities, there are several shortcomings present in it.
- This project did help me better understand parameters and how to use them. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

- To make this program more readable I tried to provide ample comments so that every line was understandable.
- This program needs further work to be more maintainbale and adaptable.
- As it stands now it is failry hard set without being able to easily make changes without breaking something.
